	<h2>About Crazy Joe’s Shisha Cafe</h2>

	<div id="content">
			<p>
			  As everyone on both sides of the debate knows full well, it’s no longer legal to smoke in restaurants and coffee shops in London.
			There is, however, one exception to the rule, a place where people smoke every day with their coffee and tea — legally sanctioned.
			At Crazy Joe’s Shisha Cafe, customers are invited to smoke from a shisha pipe, puffing herbal smoke in a dozen flavours, all free of tobacco, tar and nicotine. Historically, the shisha pipe, also known as a hookah, has been used to smoke products with varying degrees of legality.
			The first few landlords whom cafe owner Joe Alomeiri approached about his idea shied away for that reason.
			“They were afraid of what people would be smoking, but we keep complete control over the substance that goes in, and it’s all herbal with flavours such as apple, mango, mint and strawberry.”
